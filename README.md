Using streamlit and several data analysis libraries in Python we made a covid case tracking web app that displays daily and cumulative cases by country. We did this through pulling the raw data of confirmed cases from the Center for Systems Science Engineering Covid Dashboard, formatting the data into a compatible data frame and the correct data types. We then used streamlit commands to format the webapp to make selection boxes and graphic displays, that displayed information about cases from the corresponding country in the same column.
